  step_1_description: "Create your account with an username and password. No email, phone or login through third party
    services required."
  step_2: "Step 2 - Link your server"
  step_2_description: "Now that you are logged in, click the 'New server' button. This will generate a random token and give you a
    line to paste in your server's crontab."
  step_3: "Step 3 - And that's all!"
  step_3_description: "The crontab you pasted will run our data collector script, send information to our servers and we will generate a simple but
    powerful dashboard for all your servers."
  value_privacy: "We value your privacy"
  value_privacy_description: "You don't need to provide any email or contact form, so there is no information about you stored on our servers. You can fully control the data sent to our servers

    information and reports at any time."
